# Hypixel-Skyblock-Flipping-Calculator
This helpful tool for viewing and calculating Hypixel Skyblock numbers while offline.

This calculator was originally created at:
https://replit.com/@Stookalacka/Hypixel-Skyblock-Flipping-Calculator
go there for the original :)

How it works:
At first, you will be asked "What would you like to do?; Type 'Help' for list of commands"

List of commands:

bz:

  Allows offline viewing of bazaar
  After typing which item you want to search, you will be given the Buy and Sell price of that item
  If you get an error, that means that the item doesn't exist.  Check your spelling and try again
  
ah:

  Allows offline viewing of the auction house
  Firstly, you will be asked if you want BIN (Buy it now), regular auction, or both.  Type "bin", "auction", or "both"
  Secondly, you will be asked what item you want to search for.  SPELLING AND CAPITALIZATION MATTER!
    Most items start with a capital letter and have capital letters in most major words.  example: Aspect of the End
  Thirdly, you will be asked how you want the data sorted.  Be sure to type the number that correlates with the option you want.
  Fourthly, you will be asked how many auctions you want to be displayed.  You can type a number, or type a, which shows all
  Finally, those items will be found.  There are usually about 70 thousand auctions, so this process takes about 15 seconds.  Please be patient.
  
ahuuid:

  Allows you to type/paste the UUID of an auction, and the data of that auction is given.
  
flip:

  Flipping calculations are not a current feature.  Hopefully, ending soon flipping, bazaar flipping, and other forms of auction flipping will be added in the near future.
